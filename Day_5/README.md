# Day 5 - Incomplete Conditional Logic and Case Statements

Day 5 focuses on understanding incomplete conditional statements,
case statements, multiplexers, demultiplexers, partial assignments,
and their effect on RTL simulation and logic synthesis.

In this session, I worked with incomplete `if` statements, incomplete
case statements, bad and complete case statements, multiplexers,
demultiplexers, partial case assignments, and a Ripple Carry Adder.

The RTL designs were simulated using Icarus Verilog and the waveforms
were observed using GTKWave. The designs were synthesized using Yosys
to analyze the resulting netlists and block diagrams.

# 2. Incomplete IF

## What I designed

In this experiment, I worked with an incomplete `if` statement.

An incomplete `if` statement occurs when an output is assigned only
for one condition and no assignment is provided for the other
condition.

For example:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (i0)
        y = i1;
end
```

When `i0` is `0`, the output `y` is not assigned.

Therefore, the synthesis tool may infer a latch to retain the
previous value of `y`.

## Simulation

The design was simulated using Icarus Verilog and the waveform was
observed using GTKWave.

The input signals and output `y` were observed during simulation.

### GTKWave Simulation Result

## Synthesis

The design was synthesized using Yosys.

The synthesized circuit contains a latch element because the output
is not assigned for every possible condition.

### Yosys Synthesis Result

The design uses multiple input signals and conditional logic. The
output is not assigned for every possible input condition.

The purpose was to understand how Yosys handles incomplete
conditional logic containing multiple signals.

# 4. Incomplete Case

## What I designed

In this experiment, I worked with an incomplete `case` statement.

A case statement is commonly used to implement selection logic.

An incomplete case statement occurs when assignments are not provided
for all possible values of the select signal.

When the output is not assigned for some conditions, the synthesis
tool may infer a latch.

## Simulation

The design was simulated using Icarus Verilog and the waveform was
observed using GTKWave.

The clock, input signals, reset, select signal, and output were
observed during simulation.

statement.

case assignments affect the output during simulation and the hardware
generated during synthesis.

# 6. Complete Case

## What I designed

A complete case statement provides an assignment for every possible
condition.

Complete case statements are useful for designing combinational logic
without unintended latch inference.

The design was synthesized using Yosys.

The synthesized netlist and block diagram were observed to understand
the hardware generated from the complete case statement.

the synthesis tool to implement the intended combinational logic
without unnecessary storage elements.

# 7. MUX Generate

## What I designed

In this experiment, I worked with a Multiplexer.

A Multiplexer, or MUX, is a combinational circuit that selects one
input from multiple input signals and transfers the selected input to
the output.

The selection is controlled using select lines.

The experiment was used to understand MUX implementation using RTL.

## Simulation

The MUX was simulated and the waveform was observed using GTKWave.

The input signals, select signal, and output were observed during
simulation.

# 8. DEMUX Generate

## What I designed

In this experiment, I worked with a Demultiplexer.

A Demultiplexer, or DEMUX, takes a single input and routes it to one
of several output lines depending on the select signal.

The design was used to understand signal routing using select lines.

## Simulation

The DEMUX was simulated using the Verilog simulation flow.

GTKWave was used to observe the input, select signal, and output
signals.

### GTKWave Simulation Result

![DEMUX Generate GTKWave](./demux_generate_gtk.png)

## Result

The waveform shows that the input signal is routed to the output
selected by the select signal.

# 9. DEMUX Case

Demultiplexer.

The case statement is used to select which output receives the input
signal.

GTKWave.

# 10. Partial Case Assignment

## What I designed

In this experiment, I worked with partial assignments inside a case
statement.

A partial case assignment means that only some conditions are
assigned while other conditions are left without an assignment.

When an output is not assigned for all possible conditions, the
synthesis tool may infer a latch.

## Synthesis

The design was synthesized using Yosys.

The synthesized netlist and block diagram were observed to understand
the hardware generated from the partial case assignment.

### Yosys Synthesis Result

statements can affect the synthesized hardware and may result in
latch inference.

# 11. Ripple Carry Adder

## What I designed

In this experiment, I worked with a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA).

A Ripple Carry Adder is a digital circuit used to add two binary
numbers.

It is constructed using multiple full adders connected in series.
The carry output of one full adder is connected to the carry input of
the next full adder.

The carry propagates from the least significant bit to the most
significant bit.

## Simulation

The RCA was simulated to verify the addition operation.

The input numbers and sum output were observed using GTKWave.

The waveform shows the relationship between the input numbers and the
resulting sum.

### GTKWave Simulation Result

![RCA GTKWave](./rca.v_gtk.png)

## Result

This experiment helped me understand the basic operation of a Ripple
Carry Adder and how binary addition can be implemented using digital
logic.

# 12. RTL Simulation and Waveform Analysis

Simulation is an important step in RTL design because it allows the
functionality of the design to be verified before synthesis.

In Day 5, the RTL designs were simulated using the Verilog simulation
flow and the resulting waveforms were observed using GTKWave.

The waveforms were used to observe:

- Input signals
- Output signals
- Select signals
- Clock signals
- Reset signals
- Changes in output according to inputs
- Effects of incomplete assignments
- Multiplexer and demultiplexer operation
- Ripple Carry Adder operation

Waveform analysis helped me verify the behavior of the RTL designs
before analyzing their synthesized hardware.

---

# 13. Synthesis and Netlist Analysis

After RTL simulation, the designs were synthesized using Yosys.

Synthesis converts the RTL description into a gate-level hardware
representation.

The synthesized netlists and block diagrams were observed to
understand how the RTL code was converted into hardware.

The synthesis results helped me identify:

- Multiplexer logic
- Latch elements
- Logic gates
- Signal connections
- Hardware structures
- Hardware generated from incomplete assignments

By comparing the RTL code with the synthesized netlist, I could
understand the relationship between RTL coding style and actual
hardware implementation.

---

# 14. Latch Inference

One of the most important concepts learned in Day 5 was latch
inference.

A latch may be inferred when a combinational RTL block does not assign
a value to its output for every possible input condition.

For example:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (i0)
        y = i1;
end
```

When `i0` is `0`, no new value is assigned to `y`.

Therefore, the synthesis tool may create a latch so that `y` retains
its previous value.

Similarly, an incomplete `case` statement can also result in latch
inference when some cases do not assign a value to the output.

To avoid unintended latches:

- Assign outputs for all possible conditions.
- Use complete `if-else` statements.
- Use complete `case` statements.
- Provide default assignments where required.
- Ensure that combinational outputs are assigned for every possible
  input condition.
